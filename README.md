  # Requirements
  
  ### Usage of Git
  We are mainly using Sam's Github to work on IntelliJ. We figured that working on Repl.it would be better due to the time it would save us. We did set up our repositories and did manage to share it with others. Sam's repository is linked under "Links to Github".

  ### Show Usage of Inellij
  Each of us wrote our parts of the code and debugged it on Intellij. We then copy/pasted our sections into this Repl.

  ### Show usage of Flask and Routes
  In our main.py file, we use an app route for home.html.

  ### Show usage of Bootstrap or Jinja
  Bryce used a template of Bootstrap and was able to incorporate it into our project. We used Jinja to render an HTML template.

  ### Show your project theme
  Francis was designated to add japanese images into our portfolio to foreshadow the theme of our soon to be flask project.

  ### Show each individual having a code checkin and a comment
  Sam, Bryce, and Sriya added their own parts into the code on Repl.it and commented the purpose

# Self Grading for Week 3
## Contributions for Each Member (out of 20)
### Sriya
20/20 My contributions for this week include trying out Jinja and importing python into the code. I also put out the layout for the code. This week on our journal, I wrote down and defined some of the terms that Mr.M uses in class that we are unfamiliar with (like "route" and "Agile methodology"). 
### Sam
20/20 My contributions for this week include learning how to use Github to transfer code between Repl.it and Intellij. I was also in charge of changing color background, and changing color texts. Contributions to our journal and project plan.
